# Round-Robin and Priority Queue Process Simulator

This project is a simulator for Round-Robin and Priority Queue scheduling algorithms. The aim is to understand and demonstrate how these scheduling algorithms work by simulating their behavior in a controlled environment.

## Overview

The `operating.py` file is a key component of this project. It contains Python code that simulates the scheduling of processes using the Round-Robin and Priority Queue algorithms. This file is designed to help in the evaluation and analysis of these algorithms by providing a clear implementation and usage example.

## Features

- **Round-Robin Scheduling**: Implements the Round-Robin algorithm to manage process execution in a cyclic order.
- **Priority Queue Scheduling**: Implements the Priority Queue algorithm to manage process execution based on priority levels.
